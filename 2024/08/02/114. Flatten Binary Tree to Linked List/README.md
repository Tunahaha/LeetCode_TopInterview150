#### Problem Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":
* The "linked list" should use the same `TreeNode` class where the `right` child pointer points to the next node in the list and the `left` child pointer is always `null`.
* The "linked list" should be in the same order as a **pre-order traversal** of the binary tree.
